    <string name="portoLocalSmallDescription05">Ribeira is Porto\'s biggest heart-stealer</string>
    <string name="portoLocalDescription05">Ribeira is Porto\'s biggest heart-stealer. Its Unesco World Heritage maze of medieval alleys zigzags down to the Douro River
        and a promenade lined with slender, pastel-hued houses and hole-in-the-wall tascas (taverns), with front-row views of the spectacular Ponte de Dom Luís I and
        the port-wine lodges across the river in Vila Nova de Gaia. Jam-packed with sights, shops and restaurants (and flocks of tourists), this historic neighbourhood is postcard Porto.</string>

    <string name="portoLocalSmallDescription06">Igreja de São Francisco</string>
    <string name="portoLocalDescription06">Igreja de São Francisco looks from the outside to be an austerely Gothic church, but inside it hides one of Portugal\’s most dazzling
        displays of baroque finery. Hardly a centimetre escapes unsmothered, as otherworldly cherubs and sober monks are drowned by nearly 100kg of gold leaf.
        If you see only one church in Porto, make it this one.</string>

    <string name="portoLocalDescription07">This fabulous cultural institution combines a museum, a mansion and extensive gardens. Cutting-edge exhibitions, along with a
        fine permanent collection featuring works from the late 1960s to the present, are showcased in the Museu de Arte Contemporânea, an arrestingly minimalist,
        whitewashed space designed by the eminent Porto-based architect Álvaro Siza Vieira. The delightful, pink Casa de Serralves is a prime example of art deco, bearing the imprint
        of French architect Charles Siclis. One ticket gets you into both museums.</string>

    <string name="portoLocalDescription08">From Praça da Ribeira rises a tangle of medieval alleys and stairways that eventually reach the hulking, hilltop fortress of the cathedral.
        Founded in the 12th century, it was largely rebuilt a century later and then extensively altered during the 18th century. However, you can still make out the church’s Romanesque
        origins in the barrel-vaulted nave. Inside, a rose window and a 14th-century Gothic cloister also remain from its early days. </string>

    <string name="portoLocalDescription09">High on a hill in Miragaia, this decadent five-star boutique hotel hit the ground when it opened in autumn 2017.

        The restaurant, 33 Alameda, is highly recommended.</string>

        the eponymous chef creates culinary fireworks using first-class ingredients from land and sea – be it ultra-fresh Atlantic bivalves or Alentejano black pork cooked to

    <string name="portoLocalDescription14">So you came for the steak, right? Wise decision. A welcome newcomer to Porto\'s food scene, MUU has carved out a name for itself
        with outstanding cuts of beef. Homemade Scotch eggs and cheese gratins prelude the main act: a garlic-rubbed rib-eye, say, or tender Black Angus steak.
        Either way, you won't leave hungry.</string>

        and vintage knickknacks ranging from a bicycle to an old typewriter. The menu is just as informal – petiscos such as pica-pau steak (bite-sized pieces of steak in a garlic-white-wine
        sauce), quail egg croquettes, and cheesecake served in a flower pot reveal a pinch of creativity.</string>
